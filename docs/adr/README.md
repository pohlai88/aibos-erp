# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) that document important architectural decisions made during the development of the AI-BOS ERP platform.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records are documents that capture important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences. They help maintain a record of why certain decisions were made and provide context for future development.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

1. **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
2. **Context**: The situation that led to this decision
3. **Decision**: The architectural decision made
4. **Consequences**: The positive and negative outcomes of the decision

## Current ADRs

## How to Create New ADRs

1. **Identify the need**: When making a significant architectural decision
2. **Create the ADR**: Use the template below
3. **Review**: Have the decision reviewed by the team
4. **Update status**: Mark as Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
5. **Communicate**: Share the decision with the team

## ADR Template

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Title]

## Status
[Proposed/Accepted/Deprecated/Superseded]

## Date
[YYYY-MM-DD]

## Context
[Describe the situation that led to this decision]

## Decision
[Describe the architectural decision made]

## Consequences
[Describe the positive and negative outcomes]

### Positive
- [List positive outcomes]

### Negative
- [List negative outcomes]

## Alternatives Considered
[Describe other options that were considered]

## References
[Link to relevant documentation, discussions, or resources]
```

## ADR Lifecycle

1. **Proposed**: Initial decision proposal
2. **Accepted**: Decision approved and implemented
3. **Deprecated**: Decision is no longer recommended
4. **Superseded**: Decision replaced by a newer ADR

## Contributing to ADRs

- **New ADRs**: Create new ADRs for significant architectural decisions
- **Updates**: Update ADR status when decisions change
- **Reviews**: Review existing ADRs for accuracy and relevance
- **Deprecation**: Mark outdated ADRs as deprecated
