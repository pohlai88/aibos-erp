**Based on:** AI-BOS ERP Blueprint v1.2  
**Cross-Reference:** AI-BOS ERP Enhanced Drift-Proof Master Plan (DoD, Anti-Drift, Allow/Forbid Guardrails) v1.1  
**Purpose:** Comprehensive development roadmap with strategic phases, dependencies, and resource planning  
**Timeline:** 24-week development cycle with 4 major phases  

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

This master plan breaks down the v1.2 blueprint into **4 strategic phases** over **24 weeks**, designed to deliver a production-ready ERP system with incremental value delivery. Each phase builds upon the previous, ensuring continuous integration and early feedback loops.

### **Phase Overview**
- **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-6):** Foundation & Core Platform
- **Phase 2 (Weeks 7-12):** Financial & Inventory Core
- **Phase 3 (Weeks 13-18):** Commercial Operations
- **Phase 4 (Weeks 19-24):** Advanced Features & Scale

---

## 📊 Development Strategy & Reasoning

### **Why This Phased Approach?**

1. **Risk Mitigation:** Early validation of core architecture patterns
2. **Value Delivery:** Each phase delivers working functionality
3. **Team Learning:** Gradual complexity increase for Event Sourcing adoption
4. **Stakeholder Confidence:** Regular demos and feedback cycles
5. **Technical Debt Prevention:** Foundation-first approach prevents rework

### **Critical Success Factors**
- **Foundation First:** Robust platform before business logic
- **Event Sourcing Mastery:** Accounting/Inventory ES patterns established early
- **Multi-Tenant Safety:** RLS and isolation tested from day one
- **Observability Native:** Monitoring built-in, not bolted-on
